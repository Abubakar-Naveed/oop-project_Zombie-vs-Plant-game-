# Plants vs. Zombies - OOP Final Project

Plants vs. Zombies is a captivating tower defense game developed as the culmination of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Inspired by the iconic game of the same name, this project demonstrates the application of fundamental OOP principles in creating an engaging and strategic gaming experience.

## Project Overview

In this C++ game, players assume the role of defenders of their garden against hordes of advancing zombies. The objective is to strategically place different types of plants along the garden's grid to fend off waves of zombies before they reach the house. Each plant has unique attributes and abilities, such as shooting projectiles, slowing down enemies, or providing resources to the player.

## Key Features

### Diverse Plant and Zombie Classes
The game features a variety of plant classes, including offensive plants like Peashooters, defensive plants like Wall-nuts, and support plants like Sunflowers. Each plant class is designed with specific attributes that influence gameplay strategy. Similarly, zombies come in various types, each with distinct behaviors and capabilities, challenging players to adapt their defensive tactics.

### Resource Management
Sunlight serves as the game's primary resource, which players collect over time from Sunflowers or by defeating certain zombies. This resource is used to purchase and place plants strategically on the garden grid. Effective resource management is crucial for maintaining a robust defense against increasingly formidable zombie waves.

### Progressive Difficulty and Level Design
Plants vs. Zombies offers multiple levels of increasing difficulty, each introducing new challenges and requiring strategic adjustments in plant placement and resource allocation. As players progress through levels, they unlock new plants and encounter stronger zombie types, adding depth and replay value to the gameplay experience.

### Complete Game Logic Implementation
The project includes comprehensive implementation of all core game mechanics, such as grid-based garden layout, plant and zombie interactions, user input handling, and level progression. Every aspect of gameplay is meticulously designed to provide a seamless and immersive gaming experience, adhering to the principles of object-oriented design.

## Technical Details

The game leverages object-oriented programming principles extensively. Key classes include `Plant` and `Zombie` base classes, from which specific plant and zombie types inherit. The `GameBoard` class manages the garden grid and oversees the placement and interaction of plants and zombies. Encapsulation ensures that each class maintains its responsibilities while supporting modular and scalable development.

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation focuses on core gameplay mechanics without animations, future iterations could incorporate visual enhancements, sound effects, and additional gameplay features to further enrich the gaming experience.

## Conclusion

Plants vs. Zombies represents not only a successful application of OOP concepts but also a testament to the creativity and technical skill applied in game development. It provides an interactive platform for players to strategize, defend, and engage in a thrilling battle against the undead, showcasing the potential of object-oriented programming in crafting immersive and entertaining software applications.
